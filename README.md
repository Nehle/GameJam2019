Starter repository for the "Make a game"-session of the K-weekend in Spring 2019


## Client

### Stack
- [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) (Game-engine)
- [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) ([preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env)) (Transpiler)
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) (Module bundler)
- [Jest 22](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) (Unit test runner)

### Requirements
- Node JS 8 (probably will work with 6 but haven't tested)

### How to use
`npm install` will install the packages needed.

`npm start` will start client.

`npm run build` will produce a build of the client.

`npm test` will run all client tests, if any, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Credits
The client has code mostly taken from Deniel Dzadik's [repository](https://github.com/denield/phaser-babel-webpack-boilerplate)
